"""
Architecture optimization utilities for hardware-aware model optimization in medical imaging.

This module provides comprehensive implementations of modern neural network optimization
techniques specifically designed for clinical deployment scenarios. Focuses on reducing
computational overhead, memory usage, and inference latency while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy for the PneumoniaMNIST binary classification task.

Key optimization strategies:
    - Interpolation Removal: Eliminates computational overhead from resolution upscaling
    - Depthwise Separable Convolutions: Reduces parameters and FLOPs significantly
    - Grouped Convolutions: Parallel channel processing for improved efficiency
    - Inverted Residual Blocks: Mobile-optimized residual architectures
    - Low-Rank Factorization: Matrix decomposition for parameter reduction
    - Channel Optimization: Memory layout and activation optimizations
    - Parameter Sharing: Weight reuse across similar layer configurations
