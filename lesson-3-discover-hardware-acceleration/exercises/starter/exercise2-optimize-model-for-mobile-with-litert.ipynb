You are tasked with optimizing the core model inference from 25 FPS to 60+ FPS to give your production pipeline sufficient headroom for smooth user experience.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you have uncovered LiteRT's mobile optimization capabilities by implementing and benchmarking different delegate configurations, threading strategies, and precision optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Mobile deployment success depends on matching hardware acceleration strategies to specific app requirements and device constraints. LiteRT's delegate system provides the flexibility to optimize for performance, power efficiency, or broad compatibility without changing your model architecture.\n",
